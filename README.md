# Customer-Segmentation-Unsupervized-Learning-
This project covers the use of unsupervised learning for customer segmentation on data from a grocery store's customer records. Customer segmentation separates customers into clusters that reflect similarities among customer groups. Segmentation is done to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. This helps businesses cater to the needs and concerns of different types of customers and to modify products and services according to the distinct needs and behaviors of their customer groups.
