# Customer-Segmentation-Unsupervized-Learning-
This project covers the use of unsupervised learning for customer segmentation on data from a grocery store's costomer records. Customer segmenation seperates customers into clusters that reflect similaries amoung customer groups. Segmentation is done to optimize the significance of each customer to the business. This helps businesses cater to the needs and conceners of different types of customers and to modify products and servises according to the distinct needs and behaviours of thier customer groups.
